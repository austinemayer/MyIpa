For our limited-edition Vintage Blonde, it just happened to be a grape from California and a 27-year after-work hobby.\r\n\r\nKeith has an obvious passion for brewing beer. That goes without saying. But he also has a little-known passion for wine-making. In 1995, while he was crushing grapes and thinking back to his travels through California and French wine country, the idea of blending a beer with a wine popped into his head. Intrigued, he had to give it a shot.\r\n\r\nHe started by using the juice of Chardonnay grapes to give the beer a crisp, light quality, very much like a glass of Chardonnay. He then used white wheat as the only grain to create a clean, smooth finish that could not be achieved with other malts. After cellar-aging the batch for a couple of months, he tasted his latest work. He was pleasantly surprised with the clarity and refreshing taste.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, with wine and Craft beer growing in popularity with drinkers, he decided it would be a good time to bring it back. After a couple of years at festivals and special events, it started to gain a following. Then in 2010, it just happened to take home a gold medal from the Great American Beer Festival\u00ae. Knowing an ale this good should be shared, we distributed it in 2011 as Vintage Blonde Ale\u2122. So now, after six years, Vintage Blonde Ale is released nationally for all to enjoy.","abv":"8.5","ibu":"2","glasswareId":8,"availableId":2,"styleId":114,"isOrganic":"N","year":2012,"labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/mYTqbC\/upload_JcH4dL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/mYTqbC\/upload_JcH4dL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/mYTqbC\/upload_JcH4dL-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"The Chardonnay-grape character of Vintage Blonde Ale pairs well with grilled seafood, chicken, pork, or light salads.\r\n\r\nOne of our favorite recipes to pair with Blue Moon\u00ae Vintage Blonde Ale is Cedar Plank Salmon.","originalGravity":"1.07","createDate":"2012-09-03 18:57:40","updateDate":"2014-07-25 14:47:07","glass":{"id":8,"name":"Tulip","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":114,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Wheat Ale or Lager with or without Yeast","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived.

The outcome is a smooth, flavorful summer pale ale made with 100% Organic malted barley.\r\n\r\nThe first thing you'll notice about Copper Moon is the coppery orange luminescence radiating out of the pint glass. This comes from the special combination of three different Organic malts in every batch. Those Organic malts also impart a flavorsome yet summery smooth sweetness that quenches your thirst at the same time as tantalizing your taste buds. The upfront hop bitterness of Copper Moon is relatively low, complementing the malts nicely without being overpowering. The hop flavor and aroma are another matter, as the Centennial hops used in the latter stages of each batch intermingle delightfully to generate a dazzling citrusy, flowery and slightly spicy olfactory experience. All these things blend into a refreshing, flavorful and organic Summer Pale Ale.
